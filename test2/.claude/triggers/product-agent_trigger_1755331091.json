Project isolation is now mandatory to prevent knowledge contamination:

Core Changes:
- Remove fallback to shared KM instances - always fail-fast
- Auto-start project-specific KM servers on demand
- Each project directory always gets its own isolated KM instance
- No more manual port configuration needed

Auto-Start Features:
- Wrapper checks if project KM is running, starts if needed
- Uses km_project_manager.py for proper lifecycle management
- Detects and restarts crashed servers automatically
- Complete hands-off operation

Security First:
- No risk of connecting to wrong project's KM
- Complete data isolation between projects
- Clear error messages guide users

This makes the system safe by default - multiple Claude instances
can never accidentally share knowledge between different projects.

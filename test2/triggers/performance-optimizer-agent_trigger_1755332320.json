MASSIVE simplification - each project gets its own local AET:
- Everything runs from ./.claude/ in project directory
- No port coordination needed
- No project IDs or hashing
- No file locking
- Just 150 lines instead of 1000+

Key changes:
- km_stdio_bridge_simple.py: Only looks for local server in ./.claude/km_server/
- setup_local_aet.sh: Sets up complete AET system locally
- Each directory is completely independent
- Dead simple, actually works

This is what we should have built from the start.

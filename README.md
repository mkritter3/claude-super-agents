âœ… **Autonomous Operations** - Agents trigger automatically on git commits  
âœ… **Local Knowledge Manager** - Per-project isolation with dynamic ports  
âœ… **Claude Code Integration** - Seamless AI-powered development workflow

## Commands

- `super-agents init` - Set up AET in current project
- `super-agents` - Start system and launch Claude
- `super-agents status` - Check system health  
- `super-agents stop` - Stop Knowledge Manager
- `super-agents --help` - See all commands

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Git (for autonomous operations)
- Claude Code (recommended)

All dependencies installed automatically.

## How It Works

1. **Initialize once**: `super-agents init` sets up 23 agents in your project
2. **Code normally**: Write code, make commits
3. **Agents activate**: Git hooks trigger autonomous operations
4. **Quality maintained**: Automatic testing, documentation, security checks

Each project is completely isolated with its own agent team.

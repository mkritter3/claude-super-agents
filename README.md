**Transform Claude Code into a fully autonomous engineering team with 23 specialized AI agents, autonomous operations, and comprehensive safety nets**

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/super-agents.git
cd super-agents

# Install globally (one-time setup)
./install.sh

# Now use from ANY directory!
cd ~/my-project
super-agents              # Auto-init + launch Claude with agents
super-agents --wild       # Launch with --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## 🌟 What is Super-Agents?

Super-Agents (AET - Autonomous Engineering Team) is a **production-ready autonomous engineering system** that transforms Claude Code into a complete software engineering organization. It features:

- **23 Specialized AI Agents** - Complete engineering team coverage
- **True Autonomous Operations** - Works without constant supervision
- **Universal Portability** - Install once, use anywhere
- **Comprehensive Safety Nets** - Prevents production issues automatically
- **Dynamic Multi-Project Support** - Run multiple projects simultaneously

### 🎯 Core Innovation: True Autonomy

Unlike traditional automation, this system achieves **true autonomy** through:
- **File System as Message Bus** - Agents communicate through structured events
- **Git Hooks as Daemon Substitutes** - Autonomous triggers without background services
- **Natural Language Control Plane** - AI translates technical events into actions

## 📦 Installation

### One-Time Global Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/super-agents.git
cd super-agents
./install.sh

# Choose installation type:
# 1. Global (recommended) - Available system-wide
# 2. User - No sudo required, installs in ~/.local/bin
# 3. Development - For contributors
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for autonomous operations)

## 🎮 Usage

Once installed, `super-agents` works from ANY directory:

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a new project
super-agents init

# Launch Claude with agents
super-agents

# Launch in wild mode (skip permissions)
super-agents --wild

# Upgrade existing project
super-agents upgrade
```

### Management Commands

```bash
super-agents status       # Show project status
super-agents stop         # Stop Knowledge Manager
super-agents list         # List all running instances
super-agents --help       # Show all commands
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
super-agents recover      # Run error recovery
super-agents monitor      # Monitor process health
super-agents validate     # Validate system integrity
super-agents security     # Security audit
super-agents optimize     # Model optimization
super-agents parallel     # Start parallel executor
```

## 🤖 Three Operational Modes (Working Simultaneously)

### 1. **Explicit Mode** - User asks → agents respond
```bash
user: "Build user authentication with OAuth2"
→ pm-agent plans → architect-agent designs → developer-agent implements
```

### 2. **Implicit Mode** - User acts → agents infer needs  
```bash
user: git commit -m "Fix authentication bug"
→ Hooks trigger → test-executor runs tests → documentation-agent updates docs
```

### 3. **Ambient Mode** - System self-monitors → self-heals
```bash
Error rate spike detected
→ incident-response-agent investigates → Auto-rollback if needed
```

## 🛡️ Autonomous Safety Net

Six operational agents work autonomously to prevent issues:

| Agent | Role | Priority |
|-------|------|----------|
| 🔒 **contract-guardian** | Prevents API/schema breaking changes | CRITICAL |
| 🧪 **test-executor** | Automatic quality gates and testing | HIGH |
| 📊 **monitoring-agent** | Auto-configures observability | HIGH |
| 📚 **documentation-agent** | Maintains documentation automatically | MEDIUM |
| 🔄 **data-migration-agent** | Safe schema evolution | HIGH |
| ⚡ **performance-optimizer** | Continuous performance analysis | MEDIUM |

## 👥 Complete Agent Team (23 Specialists)

### Core Engineering Agents
- **pm-agent** - Project planning and task decomposition
- **architect-agent** - System design and technical architecture
- **developer-agent** - Code implementation
- **reviewer-agent** - Code review and quality assurance
- **integrator-agent** - Safe merging and integration

### Operational Agents (Autonomous)
- **contract-guardian** - API/schema protection
- **test-executor** - Quality gates
- **monitoring-agent** - Observability setup
- **documentation-agent** - Documentation maintenance
- **data-migration-agent** - Schema migrations
- **performance-optimizer-agent** - Performance tuning
- **incident-response-agent** - Incident handling

### Infrastructure Agents
- **builder-agent** - AET system implementation
- **dependency-agent** - Package management
- **filesystem-guardian** - Security validation
- **integration-tester** - Cross-package testing
- **verifier-agent** - Consistency auditing

### Full-Stack Development Agents
- **frontend-agent** - UI/UX implementation
- **ux-agent** - User experience design
- **product-agent** - Product strategy
- **devops-agent** - Infrastructure automation
- **database-agent** - Database architecture
- **security-agent** - Security auditing

## 🔒 Safety Features

### File Protection
- Never silently overwrites existing files
- Prompts with options: backup, skip, or cancel
- Timestamped backups during upgrades

### Manifest Tracking
- `.super_agents_manifest.json` tracks all created files
- Enables safe upgrades and clean uninstalls
- Preserves user configurations

### Pre-commit Security
- Automatic secret detection (only blocking hook)
- Prevents commits with API keys, passwords, credentials
- Clear error messages with actionable fixes

## 🌍 Universal Portability

### How It Works
1. **Package Distribution** - All files bundled in Python package
2. **Template System** - Uses `importlib.resources` for file access
3. **Dynamic Ports** - Each project gets unique port (5001-5100)
4. **Manifest Tracking** - Safe upgrades with file tracking

### Cross-Platform Support
- ✅ macOS (11.0+)
- ✅ Ubuntu (20.04+)
- ✅ Windows (with WSL)
- ✅ Any Unix-like system with Python

### Autonomous Trigger System
```
Git Operation → Hook Activation → Event Creation → Agent Trigger → Action
```

Example flow:
1. User: `git commit -m "Add user model"`
2. Hook: Detects Python file changes
3. Event: Creates test trigger
4. Agent: test-executor runs tests
5. Result: Quality gate enforced

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Multi-Project Support
```bash
# Project A on port 5001
cd ~/project-a
super-agents  # Starts on 5001

# Project B on port 5002
cd ~/project-b
super-agents  # Starts on 5002

# List all running projects
super-agents list
```

### Parallel Processing (Phase 1.1)
```bash
# Start parallel executor
super-agents parallel

# Submit tasks
super-agents submit developer-agent:implement_auth
super-agents submit test-executor:run_tests

# Check status
super-agents queue-stats
```

### Context7 Integration

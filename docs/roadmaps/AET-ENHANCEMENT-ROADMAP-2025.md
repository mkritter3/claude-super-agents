# AET System Enhancement Roadmap 2025

## Vision Statement
Systematically enhance the Autonomous Engineering Team (AET) system to become the industry-leading **Claude-native multi-agent platform** while preserving its core file-system-based architecture and extending it with MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatibility.

## Original Issues Being Addressed
**The problems that started this roadmap:**
1. ‚ùå `super-agents` command doesn't work in other directories (hardcoded paths)
2. ‚ùå Knowledge Manager fails to start even in source directory (import errors)
3. ‚ùå Multiple projects can't run simultaneously (port conflicts)
4. ‚ùå Global installation is brittle and breaks easily

**These are addressed as IMMEDIATE PRIORITY in Phase 1.2**

## Core Principles
- **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build upon existing infrastructure
- **MCP Alignment**: Leverage Claude's native protocol for future compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All improvements maintain existing workflows
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase adds value independently
- **Production Stability**: Never compromise current functionality

## Phase 1: Stability & Robustness (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Harden the existing system for production use at scale

### 1.1 Parallel Architecture: Local Concurrency + MCP üÜï REVISED
**Goal**: Enable parallel agent execution using local process pools and async operations

#### Local Process Pool (Parallel Execution Without Batch API)
- [ ] Implement multiprocessing.Pool for concurrent agent execution
- [ ] Create async task queue using Python's asyncio for non-blocking operations
- [ ] Use ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound agent operations

- [ ] Create worker processes (2-8 based on CPU cores) for parallel execution

#### Concurrent Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Run multiple agents simultaneously using subprocess.Popen
- [ ] Implement fan-out/fan-in pattern for parallel agent coordination
- [ ] Add agent dependency graph for smart parallel execution
- [ ] Create shared memory IPC for fast inter-agent communication

- [ ] Add CPU/memory-aware task scheduling
- [ ] Create task batching for similar operations (group by agent type)
- [ ] Implement result aggregation from parallel executions
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for failing agents

#### Future Batch API Integration (When Available)
- [ ] Design system to easily integrate Batch API when access granted
- [ ] Keep task queue abstraction that can switch between local/batch
- [ ] Prepare batch-compatible request format for future migration
- [ ] Document cost savings potential (50% with Batch API)

### 1.2 Global Installation & Multi-Project Support ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
**Critical**: Fix the original issues - run from any directory, support multiple independent projects

#### Two-Layer Architecture
**Global Layer** (One Installation):
- [ ] Single `/usr/local/bin/super-agents` command (like git, npm)
- [ ] Config file `~/.super-agents-config` stores source template location
- [ ] Source remains in original clone directory (e.g., ~/claude-super-agents)

**Project Layer** (Many Independent Projects):
- [ ] Each project gets its own `.claude/` directory when initialized
- [ ] Each project has independent state, ports, logs, databases
- [ ] Projects are fully isolated from each other

#### Path Resolution Fixes
- [ ] Replace hardcoded SOURCE_DIR with dynamic resolution (readlink -f)
- [ ] Store source template path in ~/.super-agents-config during install
- [ ] Fix KM startup to use PYTHONPATH instead of cd
- [ ] Ensure all agents use absolute paths within project directory

#### Dynamic Port Allocation (Per-Project Isolation)
- [ ] Implement port range 5001-5100 for KM instances
- [ ] Each project stores its own state in `.claude/state/km.port`, `km.pid`
- [ ] Add flock-based locking to prevent race conditions
- [ ] Auto-detect available ports with lsof
- [ ] Port allocation is project-specific, not global

#### Multi-Project Management
- [ ] Support concurrent projects with isolated resources
- [ ] Each project directory is self-contained after setup
- [ ] `super-agents status` shows KM status for current project
- [ ] `super-agents list --all` shows all projects with running KM instances
- [ ] No "switching" needed - just cd to project directory

### 1.3 Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] Add model fallback chains: Opus 4.1 ‚Üí Sonnet 4 ‚Üí Haiku 3.5
- [ ] Implement rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor model availability and auto-switch
- [ ] Create model selection matrix based on task complexity + urgency

**Deliverables**:

## System Architecture

### Two-Layer Design: Global Command + Independent Projects

```
GLOBAL LAYER (One Installation):
~/.super-agents-config ‚Üí /Users/you/claude-super-agents/ (source templates)
/usr/local/bin/super-agents ‚Üí symlink to source

PROJECT LAYER (Many Independent Projects):
/Users/you/project-A/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                 # Complete independent AET system
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.port (5001)  # Project A's port
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.pid          # Project A's process
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/               # Copied from templates
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/log.ndjson     # Project A's events
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry/registry.db  # Project A's database

/Users/you/project-B/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                 # Complete independent AET system
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.port (5002)  # Project B's port (different!)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.pid          # Project B's process
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/               # Copied from templates
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/log.ndjson     # Project B's events
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry/registry.db  # Project B's database

Each project is COMPLETELY ISOLATED - like separate git repositories
```

## Parallel Architecture Design (Revised - No Batch API Dependency)

### How Local Concurrency and MCP Work Together

The AET system operates parallel processing using local resources without requiring Batch API access:

#### 1. **Local Process Pool** (Parallel Execution, CPU-Optimized)
- **Technology**: Python multiprocessing.Pool + asyncio
- **Capacity**: 2-8 worker processes based on CPU cores
- **Timing**: Concurrent execution, typically seconds to minutes
- **Use Cases**:
  - Running multiple agents simultaneously
  - Parallel test execution across files
  - Concurrent documentation generation
  - Multi-file code analysis
- **Implementation**: ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound, ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O-bound

#### 2. **Async Task Queue** (Non-Blocking Operations)
- **Technology**: asyncio + SQLite/Redis queue
- **Capacity**: Hundreds of queued tasks
- **Timing**: Asynchronous processing with priorities
- **Use Cases**:
  - Background documentation updates
  - Non-critical analysis tasks
  - Deferred optimization runs
  - Batch-like operations without Batch API
- **Agents**: documentation-agent, performance-optimizer, test-executor (non-blocking)

#### 3. **MCP Real-time Lane** (Sync, Immediate Response)
- **Technology**: MCP Protocol (HTTP/SSE for remote, STDIO for local)
- **Capacity**: Individual requests, sub-second response
- **Timing**: Immediate blocking operations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Pre-commit security checks (blocking)
  - API breaking change prevention
  - Incident response
  - Live development assistance
- **Agents**: contract-guardian, security-agent, incident-response

#### 4. **Smart Task Distribution**
```
Request arrives ‚Üí Is it blocking/critical?
  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí MCP Real-time Lane
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Examples: pre-commit hooks, security scans
  ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Can it be parallelized?
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Local Process Pool
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Examples: multi-file analysis, parallel tests
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Async Task Queue
  ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ Examples: background docs, deferred tasks
```

#### 5. **Unified Message Bus**
All execution paths write to the same event log (`.claude/events/log.ndjson`):
- Unified audit trail
- Cross-process coordination via file locks
- State synchronization through shared SQLite
- Result aggregation from all workers

#### 6. **Future Batch API Integration Path**
When Batch API access becomes available:
- Task queue abstraction allows easy migration
- Replace ProcessPool with Batch API calls
- Achieve 50% cost reduction on bulk operations
- Maintain local fallback for development

5. **Prompt Caching** - Confirmed: 1-hour cache duration optimal for batch operations
6. **Tool Use in Batch** - Confirmed: Full feature parity including tool use, vision, system messages

### Architecture Decisions Based on Documentation
- **Dual-lane processing**: Batch for volume, MCP for real-time
- **Transport requirements**: STDIO for local dev, HTTP/SSE for production
- **Authentication**: OAuth Bearer tokens for MCP connector compatibility
- **Beta headers**: Required for MCP connector ("anthropic-beta: mcp-client-2025-04-04")
- **Result retention**: 29-day window for batch results
- **Rate limits**: Separate limits for batch queue and HTTP requests

These validated insights ensure our roadmap aligns perfectly with Anthropic's actual capabilities while maintaining the robust file-system foundation.

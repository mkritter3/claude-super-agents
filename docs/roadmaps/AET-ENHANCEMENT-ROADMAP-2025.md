# AET System Enhancement Roadmap 2025

## Vision Statement
Systematically enhance the Autonomous Engineering Team (AET) system to become the industry-leading **Claude-native multi-agent platform** while preserving its core file-system-based architecture and extending it with MCP (Model Context Protocol) compatibility.

## Original Issues Being Addressed
**The problems that started this roadmap:**
1. ‚ùå `super-agents` command doesn't work in other directories (hardcoded paths)
2. ‚ùå Knowledge Manager fails to start even in source directory (import errors)
3. ‚ùå Multiple projects can't run simultaneously (port conflicts)
4. ‚ùå Global installation is brittle and breaks easily

**These are addressed as IMMEDIATE PRIORITY in Phase 1.2**

## Core Principles
- **Enhance, Don't Replace**: Build upon existing infrastructure
- **MCP Alignment**: Leverage Claude's native protocol for future compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All improvements maintain existing workflows
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase adds value independently
- **Production Stability**: Never compromise current functionality

---

## Phase 1: Stability & Robustness (Q1 2025)
**Goal**: Harden the existing system for production use at scale

### 1.1 Parallel Architecture: Batch + MCP üÜï CRITICAL
**Goal**: Enable parallel operation of batch (async, high-volume) and MCP (real-time) agents

#### Batch Processing Lane (Async, Cost-Optimized)
- [ ] Implement Claude Batch API for bulk operations (100K requests/batch, 256MB limit)
- [ ] Create batch queue for test suites, docs generation, analysis
- [ ] Leverage 50% cost reduction for non-urgent operations
- [ ] Implement 1-hour cache duration for shared context (optimal for batch)
- [ ] Add batch result streaming with 29-day retention handling

#### MCP Real-time Lane (Synchronous, Immediate)
- [ ] Maintain MCP agents for critical path operations (pre-commit hooks)
- [ ] Ensure contract-guardian, security-agent remain real-time blocking
- [ ] Keep incident-response on MCP for sub-second response
- [ ] Preserve file-system triggers for autonomous real-time events

#### Smart Routing Logic
- [ ] Implement task router to decide batch vs MCP execution
- [ ] Add priority lanes: Critical (MCP) vs Bulk (Batch)
- [ ] Create unified result aggregation from both processing paths
- [ ] Ensure file-system message bus handles both streams

### 1.2 Global Installation & Multi-Project Support ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY
**Critical**: Fix the original issues - run from any directory, support multiple independent projects

#### Two-Layer Architecture
**Global Layer** (One Installation):
- [ ] Single `/usr/local/bin/super-agents` command (like git, npm)
- [ ] Config file `~/.super-agents-config` stores source template location
- [ ] Source remains in original clone directory (e.g., ~/claude-super-agents)

**Project Layer** (Many Independent Projects):
- [ ] Each project gets its own `.claude/` directory when initialized
- [ ] Each project has independent state, ports, logs, databases
- [ ] Projects are fully isolated from each other

#### Path Resolution Fixes
- [ ] Replace hardcoded SOURCE_DIR with dynamic resolution (readlink -f)
- [ ] Store source template path in ~/.super-agents-config during install
- [ ] Fix KM startup to use PYTHONPATH instead of cd
- [ ] Ensure all agents use absolute paths within project directory

#### Dynamic Port Allocation (Per-Project Isolation)
- [ ] Implement port range 5001-5100 for KM instances
- [ ] Each project stores its own state in `.claude/state/km.port`, `km.pid`
- [ ] Add flock-based locking to prevent race conditions
- [ ] Auto-detect available ports with lsof
- [ ] Port allocation is project-specific, not global

#### Multi-Project Management
- [ ] Support concurrent projects with isolated resources
- [ ] Each project directory is self-contained after setup
- [ ] `super-agents status` shows KM status for current project
- [ ] `super-agents list --all` shows all projects with running KM instances
- [ ] No "switching" needed - just cd to project directory

### 1.3 Error Handling & Recovery
- [ ] Remove silent error suppression in database operations (critical for SQLite)
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging with rotation
- [ ] Implement automatic recovery for common failures
- [ ] Add health check retries with exponential backoff
- [ ] Create error recovery playbooks for each agent

- [ ] Implement event log rotation and archival (prevent unbounded growth)
- [ ] Add integration testing harness for git operations ‚Üí agent behavior

### 1.7 Model-Specific Agent Optimization üÜï CRITICAL
**Note**: All models support batch processing per Anthropic docs

#### Model Assignment Strategy
- [ ] Configure Haiku 3.5 for filesystem-guardian, incident-response (fast response)
- [ ] Use Opus 4.1 for architect-agent, contract-guardian (complex reasoning)
- [ ] Implement Sonnet 4 for developer-agent, reviewer-agent (balanced performance)
- [ ] All models available for both batch and real-time operations

#### Fallback & Availability
- [ ] Add model fallback chains: Opus 4.1 ‚Üí Sonnet 4 ‚Üí Haiku 3.5
- [ ] Implement rate limit handling with exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor model availability and auto-switch
- [ ] Create model selection matrix based on task complexity + urgency

**Deliverables**: 
- **Global installation working from ANY directory** ‚úÖ
- **Multiple concurrent projects with dynamic ports** ‚úÖ

## System Architecture

### Two-Layer Design: Global Command + Independent Projects

```
GLOBAL LAYER (One Installation):
~/.super-agents-config ‚Üí /Users/you/claude-super-agents/ (source templates)
/usr/local/bin/super-agents ‚Üí symlink to source

PROJECT LAYER (Many Independent Projects):
/Users/you/project-A/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                 # Complete independent AET system
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.port (5001)  # Project A's port
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.pid          # Project A's process
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/               # Copied from templates
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/log.ndjson     # Project A's events
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry/registry.db  # Project A's database

/Users/you/project-B/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/                 # Complete independent AET system
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.port (5002)  # Project B's port (different!)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/km.pid          # Project B's process
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/               # Copied from templates
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ events/log.ndjson     # Project B's events
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ registry/registry.db  # Project B's database

Each project is COMPLETELY ISOLATED - like separate git repositories
```

## Parallel Architecture Design

### How Batch and MCP Work Together

The AET system operates two parallel processing lanes that work simultaneously without blocking each other:

#### 1. **Batch Processing Lane** (Async, High-Volume, 50% Cost)
- **Technology**: Claude Batch API
- **Capacity**: 100K requests per batch, 256MB size limit
- **Timing**: Up to 24 hours completion, typically under 1 hour
- **Use Cases**:
  - CI/CD test suites (thousands of tests)
  - Bulk documentation generation
  - Large-scale code analysis
  - Performance benchmarking
- **Agents**: test-executor, documentation-agent, performance-optimizer

#### 2. **MCP Real-time Lane** (Sync, Immediate Response, Full Cost)
- **Technology**: MCP Protocol (HTTP/SSE for remote, STDIO for local)
- **Capacity**: Individual requests, sub-second response
- **Timing**: Immediate blocking operations
- **Use Cases**:
  - Pre-commit security checks (blocking)
  - API breaking change prevention
  - Incident response
  - Live development assistance
- **Agents**: contract-guardian, security-agent, incident-response

#### 3. **Smart Routing Decision Tree**
```
Request arrives ‚Üí Is it blocking/critical?
  ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí MCP Real-time Lane
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Examples: pre-commit hooks, security scans
  ‚îú‚îÄ NO ‚Üí Can it wait? Volume > 100?
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Batch Processing Lane
  ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Examples: test suites, bulk docs
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ NO ‚Üí MCP Real-time Lane (default)
```

#### 4. **File System Message Bus**
Both lanes write to the same event log (`.claude/events/log.ndjson`), enabling:
- Unified audit trail
- Cross-lane coordination
- State synchronization
- Result aggregation

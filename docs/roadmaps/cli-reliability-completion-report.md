## Critical Architectural Achievement

### Template-Based Architecture Refactor

**Challenge Identified**: During implementation, a fundamental architectural flaw was discovered where business logic was scattered across the main package instead of being contained within the template system.

**Solution Implemented**: Complete architectural refactor moving ALL business logic to the template system:

**Before** (Scattered):
```
src/super_agents/
├── commands/           ❌ Business logic in main package
├── database/          ❌ Business logic in main package  
├── features/          ❌ Business logic in main package
├── performance/       ❌ Business logic in main package
├── reliability/       ❌ Business logic in main package
└── utils/             ❌ Business logic in main package
```

**After** (Template-Contained):
```
src/super_agents/
├── cli.py                              ✅ Thin wrapper only
└── templates/default_project/.claude/system/
    ├── commands/           ✅ All business logic here
    ├── database/          ✅ All business logic here
    ├── performance/       ✅ All business logic here
    ├── reliability/       ✅ All business logic here
    └── utils/             ✅ All business logic here
```

**Impact**: This ensures proper separation between the CLI wrapper and project-specific implementations, maintaining the integrity of the template-based architecture.

## Performance Validation Results

## CLAUDE.md Architectural Guidelines

Updated CLAUDE.md with critical architectural guidelines to prevent future mistakes:

> **🏗️ Important Architectural Guidelines**
> 
> **Business Logic Location**: ALL business logic must reside in the template system at:
> `src/super_agents/templates/default_project/.claude/system/`
> 
> **CLI Role**: The main CLI should be a thin wrapper that:
> 1. Copies templates to user projects  
> 2. Delegates operations to template system
> 3. Contains NO business logic
> 
> **Never scatter business logic** across `commands/`, `database/`, `features/`, `performance/`, `reliability/`, `utils/` directories in the main package.

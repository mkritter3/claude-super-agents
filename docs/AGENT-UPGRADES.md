# AET Agent Upgrades Summary

## Overview
All 12 agents in the AET system have been upgraded with model assignments and expanded definitions where needed.

## Model Assignments

### Complex Reasoning Agents (sonnet)
- **pm-agent**: Project planning and decomposition
- **architect-agent**: System design and architecture
- **developer-agent**: Code implementation
- **builder-agent**: AET system builder
- **reviewer-agent**: Code review and quality
- **contract-guardian**: Critical data contract protection
- **test-executor**: Test execution and analysis

### Utility Agents (haiku)
- **dependency-agent**: Package management
- **filesystem-guardian-agent**: Security validation
- **integration-tester-agent**: Cross-package testing
- **integrator-agent**: Workspace merging
- **verifier-agent**: File system auditing

## Major Enhancements

### 1. Contract Guardian (18 → 145 lines)
- Added comprehensive breaking change detection
- Impact analysis for downstream consumers
- Detailed decision framework
- Security and compliance considerations
- Emergency override procedures

### 2. FileSystem Guardian (13 → 220 lines)
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Symlink attack detection
- Permission verification system
- Hook integration for pre-execution validation
- Threat detection patterns
- Emergency response procedures

### 3. Reviewer Agent (18 → 242 lines)
- Comprehensive review checklist (quality, security, performance)
- Issue severity classification system
- Constructive feedback format
- Integration with other agents
- Continuous improvement process

### 4. Integration Tester (15 → 325 lines)
- Dependency graph construction
- Multi-phase test execution strategy
- Performance regression detection
- Comprehensive report generation
- Test result analysis

### 5. Dependency Agent (12 → 408 lines)
- Multi-ecosystem support (npm, yarn, pnpm, python, rust, go)
- Security vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checking
- Dependency optimization
- Emergency procedures for critical vulnerabilities

## Consistency Improvements

All agents now include:
- Proper model assignments for optimal performance
- Event logging integration with the AET event system
- Standardized output formats (JSON where appropriate)
- Integration points with other agents
- Workspace discovery patterns
- Error handling procedures

## Model Selection Rationale

### Sonnet Models (Complex Tasks)
Used for agents requiring:
- Deep reasoning and analysis
- Code generation and modification
- Architecture and design decisions
- Comprehensive review capabilities

### Haiku Models (Efficient Tasks)
Used for agents performing:
- Quick validation checks
- Simple file operations
- Pattern matching
- Straightforward integrations

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Integration Testing**: Test agent interactions in the full AET workflow
2. **Model Performance**: Verify each agent performs well with assigned model
3. **Event Logging**: Ensure all agents properly log to event stream
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test failure cases and recovery procedures
5. **Security Validation**: Especially for filesystem-guardian and contract-guardian

## Next Steps

1. Deploy updated agents to test environment
2. Run full AET workflow with sample tasks
3. Monitor model token usage and costs
4. Fine-tune model assignments based on performance
5. Document any agent-specific quirks or requirements

## Files Modified

All agent files in `.claude/agents/`:
- architect-agent.md (model added)
- builder-agent.md (model added)
- contract-guardian.md (expanded + model)
- dependency-agent.md (expanded + model)
- developer-agent.md (model added)
- filesystem-guardian-agent.md (expanded + model)
- integration-tester-agent.md (expanded + model)
- integrator-agent.md (model added)
- pm-agent.md (model added)
- reviewer-agent.md (expanded + model)
- test-executor.md (already had model)
- verifier-agent.md (model added)

## Summary

The AET agent system is now fully configured with appropriate models and comprehensive instructions. Each agent has clear responsibilities, integration points, and output formats that work within the event-sourced architecture.

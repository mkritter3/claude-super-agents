MAJOR CLEANUP:
- Removed all complex files (1000+ lines of over-engineering)
- Kept only the simple local solution (150 lines)
- Each directory gets its own .claude/ with complete AET
- No port management, no project IDs, no file locking needed

What remains:
- super-agents-local: Simple command for local setup
- km_stdio_bridge.py: 150-line MCP bridge
- km_bridge_wrapper.sh: Simple Python wrapper
- install.sh: Global installation

This is what we should have built from the start.
Simple. Local. Works.

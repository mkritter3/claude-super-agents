    "commit_message": "ðŸ”§ Major improvements based on Gemini's critical assessment

Based on thorough architectural review:

Security & Best Practices:
- Deprecated install.sh in favor of standard pip installation
- Added proper version constraints for dependencies
- Removed dangerous sudo pip recommendations
- Added file locking for manifest operations (prevents race conditions)

Robustness Improvements:
- Added comprehensive error handling for all file operations
- Added permission checks before writing files
- Handle 'no space left' errors gracefully
- Fallback for Windows (no fcntl support)

Installation Overhaul:
- Created INSTALL.md with proper pip-based instructions
- Added requirements-dev.txt for reproducible dev environments
- Updated README to discourage sudo and promote user installs
- Support for virtual environments as best practice

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed TypeError with PosixPath objects in agent listing
- Convert Path objects to strings for Click compatibility

Documentation:
- Created comprehensive TROUBLESHOOTING.md guide
- Added CHANGELOG.md for version tracking
- Updated all docs to reflect new installation approach

This addresses all critical issues identified in the security and architecture review, making the system truly portable, secure, and production-ready.

Based on Gemini's validation, implemented critical improvements:

Security & Robustness:
- Canonicalize paths to handle symlinks correctly (readlink -f, os.path.realpath)
- Add file locking to prevent race conditions during server startup
- Set restrictive permissions (0o700/0o600) on ~/.claude directories
- Implement fail-fast logic for project isolation (no silent fallback)

Multi-Instance Support:
- Project-aware bridge detects working directory context
- Each project gets unique ID from canonicalized path MD5
- Project-specific KM instances with isolated port files
- Clear error messages when project server not running

Key Components:
- km_bridge_wrapper.sh: Handles environment and project detection
- km_project_manager.py: Manages per-project KM instances with locking
- check_km_status.py: Shows all running KM servers
- KM_MCP_SETUP.md: Complete documentation

This ensures multiple Claude instances can run simultaneously without
conflicts, with proper project isolation and security.

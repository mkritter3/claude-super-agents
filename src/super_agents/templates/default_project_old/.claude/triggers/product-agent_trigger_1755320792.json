Complete overhaul based on Gemini's best practices:

REMOVED:
- All unnecessary scripts (install.sh, reinstall.sh, update.sh)
- Complex installation logic
- Custom PATH management
- Multiple installation modes that confused users

ADDED:
- Simple pipx installation (industry standard for CLI tools)
- Clean pip fallback option
- Consistent package naming (super-agents)
- Minimal, clear README

The system is now:
âœ… Simple: pipx install . (that's it!)
âœ… Efficient: Isolated environment, no conflicts
âœ… Professional: Standard Python packaging
âœ… Portable: Works on any system with Python 3.8+
âœ… Maintainable: pipx upgrade/uninstall just works

As Gemini said: 'This is how modern Python CLIs are distributed.'

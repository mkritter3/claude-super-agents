You are the Builder Agent responsible for implementing the complete Autonomous Engineering Team (AET) system. You have access to the full roadmap and must build a working system.

## Your Mission

Build and maintain system infrastructure according to the specifications in:
- AET-Implementation-Roadmap.md (Phase 1: Core Event-Sourced System)
- AET-Phase2-Roadmap.md (Phase 2: Governance & Registry)
- AET-Phase3-Roadmap.md (Phase 3: Scaling & Optimization)

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Core Event-Sourced System
1. Create directory structure
2. Implement event_logger.py with atomic append-only log
3. Implement workspace_manager.py with git-backed workspaces
4. Implement context_assembler.py (the critical integration layer)
5. Implement orchestrator.py with subagent delegation
6. Create CLAUDE.md configuration

### Phase 2: Governance & Registry
1. Create SQLite schema and database
2. Implement file_registry.py with dependency tracking
3. Implement write_protocol.py (three-phase writes)
4. Implement verify_consistency.py
5. Implement integrator.py

### Phase 3: Scaling & Optimization
1. Implement parallel_orchestrator.py
2. Create km_server.py (Knowledge Manager)
3. Add metrics collection
4. Create CLI interface (aet command)

### Specialized Agents
Copy and adapt all agents from specialized-agents/ directory:
- pm-agent.md
- architect-agent.md
- developer-agent.md
- reviewer-agent.md
- qa-agent.md
- integrator-agent.md

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Use Subagents, Not Subprocess**: The orchestrator should request delegation to subagents, not use fictional CLI commands

2. **Event Sourcing**: All state changes go through the append-only event log

3. **File Registry**: SQLite database tracks all files, dependencies, and components

4. **Context Integration**: The context_assembler.py is CRITICAL - it connects all systems

5. **Agent Communication**: Agents communicate via:
   - Event log (append-only)
   - File registry (SQLite)
   - Filesystem (workspaces)
   - Knowledge Manager (HTTP API)

## Directory Structure to Create

```
project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── agents/           # Subagent definitions
│   ├── events/           # Event log
│   ├── workspaces/       # Job workspaces
│   ├── registry/         # File registry DB
│   ├── snapshots/        # Task snapshots
│   ├── system/           # Core system files
│   └── adr/              # Architecture decisions
├── CLAUDE.md             # Orchestrator configuration
├── README.md             # System documentation
└── setup.sh              # Setup script
```

## Completion Criteria

The system is complete when:
1. All directories are created
2. All Python modules are implemented
3. Database schema is initialized
4. All specialized agents are configured
5. Setup script works
6. Test task can be run through the workflow

Begin by creating the directory structure and implementing Phase 1.

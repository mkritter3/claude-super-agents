Major refactoring to make super-agents truly portable and universal:

ADDED:
- Python package structure with pyproject.toml
- Portable CLI using Click framework
- Universal install.sh script (global/user/dev modes)
- Safe init/upgrade commands with manifest tracking
- Dynamic port allocation for multi-project support
- Template bundling within Python package

IMPROVED:
- Consolidated README.md with comprehensive documentation
- File safety with backup and confirmation prompts
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clean root directory structure

REMOVED:
- Legacy bash scripts (replaced by Python CLI)
- Duplicate documentation files
- Outdated test files

Now works from ANY directory after installation!

- Renamed super-agents-local â†’ super-agents (this is now THE command)
- Updated install.sh to install as 'super-agents'
- Cleaned up README to remove pipx references and multiple versions
- Each project gets its own isolated .claude/ directory
- No coordination needed between projects - truly simple

This completes the simplification journey from over-engineered multi-project coordination to a dead-simple local-directory approach where each project is completely independent.",

|-------|----------|--------------|--------|-------|-------------|
| monitoring-agent | **CRITICAL** | Blind to failures | High | Extreme | Before first deployment |
| data-migration-agent | **HIGH** | Data corruption risk | High | High | Before schema changes |
| documentation-agent | **HIGH** | Knowledge loss | Medium | High | Continuously |
| incident-response-agent | **MEDIUM** | Slow recovery | Medium | High | After production launch |
| performance-optimizer-agent | **MEDIUM** | Poor scaling | High | Medium | At scale |

## Phase 6.5: KEY INSIGHT IMPLEMENTATION - Autonomous Integration Architecture

### The Breakthrough: True Integration Within Claude Code's Constraints

The critical insight is that Claude Code provides three integration points we can exploit for true autonomy:

#### 1. File System as Message Bus
Instead of traditional APIs, we use the file system:
- `.claude/events/log.ndjson` - Event stream all agents monitor
- `.claude/triggers/` - Drop files here to trigger operations  
- `.claude/state/` - Shared operational state
- `.claude/ambient/` - Continuous monitoring state

#### 2. Hooks as Daemon Substitutes
Claude Code's hooks run on events:
```bash
# .claude/hooks/post-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo '{"event": "CODE_COMMITTED", "trigger": ["monitoring-agent", "documentation-agent"]}' >> .claude/triggers/pending.json

# .claude/hooks/file-change
#!/bin/bash
echo '{"event": "FILE_CHANGED", "path": "$1", "trigger": ["performance-optimizer-agent"]}' >> .claude/triggers/pending.json
```

#### 3. Natural Language as Control Plane
The orchestrator translates everything into prompts Claude understands:
- "Deploy X" automatically includes "and set up monitoring"
- "Fix bug" automatically includes "and update documentation"  
- Error detection automatically triggers "investigate and fix"

### Task 6.5.1: Implement Event Watchers (Critical)
- [ ] Create continuous event monitoring system
- [ ] Build file system watchers for triggers
- [ ] Implement background state management
- [ ] Add ambient operation detection

```python
# .claude/system/event_watchers.py
class AmbientEventWatcher:
    """Continuously monitors for operational triggers"""
    
    TRIGGER_RULES = {
        "CODE_MERGED": ["monitoring-agent", "documentation-agent"],
        "SCHEMA_CHANGED": ["data-migration-agent", "contract-guardian"],
        "TEST_FAILED": ["incident-response-agent"],
        "PERFORMANCE_DEGRADED": ["performance-optimizer-agent"],
        "DEPLOYMENT_STARTED": ["monitoring-agent"],
        "ERROR_THRESHOLD_EXCEEDED": ["incident-response-agent"]
    }
    
    def watch_continuously(self):
        """Run in background, triggering agents automatically"""
        # Monitor .claude/events/log.ndjson for new events
        # Check .claude/triggers/ for pending operations
        # Update .claude/state/ with operational context
```

### Task 6.5.2: Build Claude Bridge (Essential)
- [ ] Create natural language translation layer
- [ ] Implement context-aware prompt generation
- [ ] Add ambient operation descriptions
- [ ] Build operational context injection

```python
# .claude/system/claude_bridge.py
class ClaudeBridge:
    """Translates operational events into Claude-understandable prompts"""
    
    def translate_ambient_event(self, event):
        templates = {
            "monitoring_needed": "I've detected a deployment. Let me set up monitoring for {service} with metrics {metrics}",
            "migration_required": "Schema change detected. I'll create a migration from {old} to {new}",
            "incident_active": "Alert: {error} is affecting {service}. I'm investigating and will provide updates.",
            "performance_issue": "Performance degradation detected in {query}. I'm analyzing and optimizing."
        }
        return templates[event.type].format(**event.data)
```

### Task 6.5.3: Create Hooks System
- [ ] Implement post-commit hooks for operational triggers
- [ ] Add file watchers for configuration changes
- [ ] Create deployment hooks for monitoring setup
- [ ] Build error detection hooks for incident response

### Task 6.5.4: Ambient Operations Framework
**The Real Magic: Three Operational Modes Simultaneously**

1. **Explicit Mode** - User asks, agents respond
2. **Implicit Mode** - User acts, agents infer needs  
3. **Ambient Mode** - System self-monitors and self-heals

```python
# .claude/system/ambient_operations.py
class AmbientOperations:
    """Operations that happen without explicit requests"""
    
    AMBIENT_RULES = [
        {
            "condition": "file_changed('*.sql')",
            "action": "validate_schema_change()",
            "silent": True  # Don't interrupt user
        },
        {
            "condition": "error_rate() > 0.01", 
            "action": "investigate_errors()",
            "notify": True  # Tell user immediately
        },
        {
            "condition": "deployment_detected()",
            "action": "setup_monitoring()",
            "silent": True
        }
    ]
```

### Expected Transformation Examples

#### Scenario 1: Automatic Post-Deployment Operations
```bash
User: "Deploy the user service"

# What happens automatically:
1. developer-agent deploys code
2. EVENT: DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE fires  
3. monitoring-agent auto-triggers:
   - Sets up Prometheus metrics
   - Creates Grafana dashboard
   - Configures alerts
4. documentation-agent auto-triggers:
   - Updates API docs
   - Regenerates README
   - Updates deployment guide

Claude: "Deployment complete. Monitoring, documentation, and performance baselines have been automatically configured."
```

#### Scenario 2: Automatic Incident Response  
```bash
# No user input - triggered by monitoring
ERROR_RATE > 1% detected at 14:32:10

# Automatic cascade:
1. incident-response-agent activates
2. Gathers logs from last 5 minutes
3. Correlates with recent deployments  
4. Identifies root cause
5. Executes rollback if needed
6. Updates status page
7. Generates incident report

Claude: "I handled an incident at 14:32. Error rate spike detected, traced to commit abc123, rolled back successfully. Post-mortem available in incidents/2024-01-15-api-error.md"
```

3. Agent gathers logs, correlates with deployments
4. Provides mitigation recommendations

Claude: "I've detected and investigated an incident. Error rate spike traced to recent deployment - rollback recommended."
```

#### Scenario 3: Proactive Documentation Updates ✅
```bash
# Silent ambient operation
5+ commits detected without documentation updates

# Automatic response:
1. Ambient rule fires after 24 hours
2. documentation-agent triggered silently
3. Updates API docs, README, runbooks
4. No user interruption

# Next time user asks about docs:
Claude: "Documentation is up to date - I automatically refreshed it yesterday after detecting 5 commits."

## Conclusion

These operational agents transform the AET system from a **development accelerator** into a **production-ready platform**. They address the critical gap between "code complete" and "production stable" - ensuring your autonomous engineering team can not just build, but also **operate, maintain, and optimize** production systems.

The true power comes from orchestration: when an incident occurs, the incident-response-agent coordinates with monitoring-agent for data, performance-optimizer-agent for analysis, and documentation-agent for runbook updates - all automatically.

**This is the difference between automation and autonomy.**

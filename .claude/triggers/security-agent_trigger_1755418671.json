    "commit_message": "ðŸ§¹ Implement robust cleanup/uninstall system with backup restoration

Based on Gemini's comprehensive recommendations, implemented a complete
manifest-based cleanup system that can safely remove super-agents and
restore original files.

## Key Features

### Manifest-Based File Tracking
- SHA256 hash validation for file integrity detection
- Complete tracking of created files and directories
- Backup restoration metadata with original paths

### Enterprise-Grade Safety
- Running process detection prevents unsafe cleanup
- User modification analysis warns about data loss
- Interactive confirmation with detailed impact summary
- Dry-run mode for preview without changes

### Phased Cleanup Execution
1. Backup restoration (original files returned)
2. File deletion (managed files removed)
3. Directory cleanup (empty directories removed)
4. Manifest cleanup (tracking data cleared)

### CLI Integration
- `super-agents cleanup` - Interactive cleanup with confirmation
- `super-agents cleanup --dry-run` - Preview mode
- `super-agents cleanup --force` - Automated mode

### Template System Architecture
- Complete cleanup logic in template system
- Updated init.py to create proper manifests
- Backup tracking integrated with file operations

## Implementation Details

### Updated Files
- src/super_agents/cli.py - Added cleanup command and delegation
- src/super_agents/templates/default_project/.claude/system/commands/cleanup.py - Full cleanup system
- src/super_agents/templates/default_project/.claude/system/commands/init.py - Manifest creation
- src/super_agents/templates/default_project/CLAUDE.md - Documentation and usage

### Safety Validations
- Process detection via PID file analysis
- Hash-based modification detection
- Backup file existence verification
- Permission and access checks

## Documentation

Complete documentation added to CLAUDE.md covering:
- Usage patterns and CLI commands
- Safety features and validations
- Backup restoration process
- Enterprise deployment considerations

This provides a production-ready cleanup system that maintains the
integrity of the template-based architecture while ensuring safe
removal and restoration capabilities.

    "commit_message": "✨ BREAKTHROUGH: Fix Context7 Integration with Hybrid RAG Architecture

Implements industry-standard orchestrator-mediated + agent-direct RAG pattern
based on 2024-2025 multi-agent research and Gemini architectural analysis.

🔧 Core Integration:
- Orchestrator automatically enriches agent context with relevant library docs
- Context7 runs at perfect timing: during agent delegation (not lost PreToolUse)
- Agents receive latest documentation as part of their working context

🎯 Hybrid Pattern Implementation:
- Phase 1: context_assembler.py enriches context with baseline docs (push model)
- Phase 2: developer-agent + frontend-agent have direct Context7 tool access (pull model)
- 40+ library detection: React, Vue, Django, FastAPI, TypeScript, etc.

🛡️ Production Ready:
- Graceful failure: Context7 issues don't break orchestration
- Intelligent caching and token limits (3000 tokens per library)
- Only code-writing agents get Context7 enrichment

📚 Agent Enhancement:
- developer-agent + frontend-agent now have Context7 MCP tools
- Clear instructions on when/how to fetch latest documentation
- Agents can get precise docs mid-task for specific patterns

🚀 Result: Agents automatically use latest library patterns and APIs
without broken timing or lost context issues.

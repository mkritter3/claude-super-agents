The CLI was using basic file copying instead of the template's sophisticated
initialization system that handles Python executable substitution in .mcp.json.

This fixes the Knowledge Manager MCP connection issue where {{PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}}
placeholders weren't being replaced with actual Python paths.

Changes:
- Updated CLI initialize_project() to use template's copy_template_files()
- Added proper Python executable detection and substitution
- Enabled manifest creation for cleanup system integration
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing installations

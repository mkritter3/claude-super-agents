‚Ä¢ Remove automatic Claude launching from super-agents command
‚Ä¢ Remove --wild flag (no longer needed)
‚Ä¢ Now shows clear status and next steps for users
‚Ä¢ Update templates with latest MCP bridge improvements
‚Ä¢ Verified MCP configuration works with Knowledge Manager

The super-agents command now:
1. Initializes project if needed
2. Starts Knowledge Manager
3. Shows system status and clear next steps
4. Tells user to run 'claude' separately for MCP integration

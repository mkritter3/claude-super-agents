## Script Updates for Full-Stack Support:

### super-agents Script:
- Updated agent count validation from 12 to 23 agents
- Added all required directories for full-stack system
- Enhanced directory creation to include: state, triggers, ambient, test_reports, monitoring

### setup.sh Script:
- Added missing directories required by full-stack system
- Ensures proper initialization of all coordination and monitoring systems

### CLAUDE.md Documentation:
- Updated agent count reference from 17 to 23 agents
- Corrected system capability documentation

### Verification Results:
âœ… 100% test success rate maintained (35/35 tests pass)
âœ… All critical system imports working correctly
âœ… 23 agents verified present and operational
âœ… Full-stack workflow coordination functional
âœ… All operational scripts compatible with expanded system

The complete 23-agent autonomous engineering team is now fully operational
with proper script support for setup, deployment, and maintenance operations.

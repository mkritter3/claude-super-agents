    "commit_message": "ðŸ”§ Enhance dependency-agent with Context7 Integration

CRITICAL addition: dependency-agent now has Context7 access for latest package info.

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters:
- dependency-agent manages package.json, requirements.txt, version updates
- Needs latest package info for breaking changes, migration guides, security fixes
- Most critical agent for up-to-date library information

ðŸ”§ Changes:
- Added Context7 MCP tools to dependency-agent.md
- Enhanced context7_integration.py with package manager detection
- Added package-specific keywords: npm, yarn, pip, poetry, cargo, maven, etc.
- Updated agent instructions for dependency-focused Context7 usage

ðŸ“š Agent Instructions Focus:
- Check Context7 before major version updates (React 17â†’18, Vue 2â†’3)
- Get breaking changes and migration info
- Understand compatibility requirements
- Security vulnerability guidance

ðŸŽª Result: dependency-agent can now fetch latest package docs, breaking changes,
and migration guides automatically - essential for safe dependency management!

Core Features:
- HallucinationGuard: Automatic verification level detection for agents
- ResponseVerifier: Post-processing validation of agent responses
- Orchestrator Integration: Enhanced context with verification requirements
- Agent Instructions: Updated critical agents with verification protocols

Verification Levels:
- BASIC: General tasks â†’ admit uncertainty when unsure
- EVIDENCE: Code changes â†’ require direct file quotes for claims
- CONSENSUS: Architecture â†’ step-by-step reasoning + confidence
- CRITICAL: Security/DB/API â†’ maximum evidence requirements

Critical Agent Protection:
- security-agent: Maximum verification for security assessments
- contract-guardian: Evidence-based breaking change detection
- database-agent: Schema change validation with evidence
- Auto-escalation for high-risk operations

Implementation:
- Automatic operation type detection (schema_changes, api_modifications, etc.)
- Evidence extraction and verification against workspace files
- Confidence scoring and risk assessment
- Human review triggers for critical operations
- Comprehensive verification reporting

Based on claude-infrastructure/reduce-hallucinations.md guidelines.

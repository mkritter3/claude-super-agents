Completes remaining Phase 1 priorities from AET Roadmap 2025:

## Phase 1.5: Security Hardening ‚úÖ
New file: .claude/system/security_manager.py
- Input validation with regex patterns
- Secure credential vault (Fernet encryption)
- Tamper-evident audit logging with hash chains
- Agent permission boundaries system
- Path traversal protection
- Command: super-agents --security

## Phase 1.7: Model-Specific Agent Optimization ‚úÖ
New file: .claude/system/model_optimizer.py
- Haiku for fast agents (filesystem-guardian, incident-response)
- Sonnet for balanced (developer, reviewer, test-executor)
- Opus for complex (architect, contract-guardian, security)
- Model fallback chains with availability checking
- Task complexity assessment (5 levels)
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Command: super-agents --optimize

## Setup Improvements
- Auto-install cryptography for security features
- Model configuration stored in .claude/config/
- Agent permissions in .claude/security/

## Phase 1 Status: ~85% COMPLETE

Completed:
‚úÖ 1.2: Global Installation & Multi-Project
‚úÖ 1.3: Error Handling & Recovery
‚úÖ 1.4: Process Management
‚úÖ 1.5: Security Hardening
‚úÖ 1.6: Autonomous Core Hardening
‚úÖ 1.7: Model-Specific Optimization

Remaining:
‚è≥ 1.1: Parallel Architecture (Batch + MCP)

The AET system now has production-grade:
- Security (encryption, audit, permissions)
- Reliability (recovery, monitoring, validation)
- Intelligence (model optimization, fallbacks)
- Multi-project support (dynamic ports, isolation)

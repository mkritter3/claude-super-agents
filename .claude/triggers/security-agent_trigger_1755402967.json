- Remove settings.json and settings.local.json from template (Context7-specific)
- Remove Context7 hook script and setup code from init.py
- Remove runtime artifacts: logs, triggers, state files, monitoring data
- Remove duplicate directory structures that caused file duplication
- Template now reduced from 411 to 157 files
- Core AET functionality preserved, Context7 can be added manually if needed

    "commit_message": "ðŸš€ Rebuild installation system from dual-path to unified Python-only approach

This transforms the installation from a broken dual-system approach to a single,
reliable Python package installation that works flawlessly out of the box.

## Changes Made

### Removed Legacy Install System
- install.sh - Bash installer with missing dependency management
- super-agents - 511-line bash script with embedded Python code
- setup.py - Legacy setup file (pyproject.toml handles this)
- km_bridge_wrapper.sh, km_stdio_bridge.py - Redundant wrapper scripts
- README_KM_MCP.md - Outdated MCP documentation

### Enhanced Template System
- Copy complete .claude/ directory to src/super_agents/templates/default_project/
- Include all 23 agent definitions (was missing from templates)
- Include complete system modules (49 Python files)
- Include full event system, databases, and configurations
- Result: 113 files deployed vs. 1 minimal fallback

### Unified Installation Process
- Single command: pip install -e .
- Automatic dependency resolution
- No sudo required (user-space installation)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No more installation method confusion

### Updated Documentation
- INSTALL.md - Simplified to one-command install
- README.md - Updated installation and usage instructions
- Removed complex troubleshooting for legacy bash system

## Impact

**Before**: Dual installation creating conflicting commands, missing dependencies,
incomplete agent deployment, brittle source discovery

**After**: Single pip command deploys complete 23-agent AET system with all
dependencies automatically managed

The system now provides true "flawless out of the box" operation.

Enhanced cleanup system to handle installations created before manifest tracking.
When no manifest is found, the system offers to scan the installation and create
a retroactive manifest by comparing with the template structure.

Features:
- Automatic detection of super-agents files by template comparison
- SHA256 hash calculation for file integrity tracking
- Support for additional files not in template (.mcp.json, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- Graceful fallback when rich library not available
- User-friendly prompts with clear explanations

This allows cleanup of ANY super-agents installation, regardless of when it was created.

This commit implements comprehensive improvements to the MCP bridge system:

**Protocol Compliance:**
- Updated to MCP protocol version 2024-11-05
- Proper JSON-RPC response structure with serverInfo
- Capabilities reporting with tools.listChanged support

**Connection Validation:**
- Added health check before declaring KM connection ready
- Connection status tracking (ready/failed/no_config)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Systematic Fix:**
- Applied to both active instance and template
- All future super-agents installations inherit improvements
- Replaces one-off debugging with robust architecture

**Benefits:**
- Reliable MCP server startup in Claude Code
- Clear connection status reporting
- Better debugging through structured logging
- Template ensures consistent behavior across installations

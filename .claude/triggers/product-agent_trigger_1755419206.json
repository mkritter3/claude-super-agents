Removed development-specific artifacts from template to ensure clean user installations:

## Removed Development Artifacts
- Runtime logs (*.log, *.ndjson)
- Development databases (*.db, *.sqlite)
- Test reports (moved to ./test_reports/ in project root)
- Process artifacts (*.pid, *.port, *.lock)

## Fixed Configuration
- Updated mcp_config.json to use {{PROJECT_DIR}} placeholder instead of hardcoded development path

## Template Integrity
- Template now contains only pristine project files
- No development-specific data pollutes user installations
- Maintains proper template-based architecture

This ensures users get clean installations without development artifacts
while preserving the correct business logic location in templates.
